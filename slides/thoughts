Focus of jQuery

$("Element").doSomething("special");

(1)Find some elements.
(2)Do something with them.

Understand the jQuery Object 

$("div").addClass("special");

$ - is the jQuery Object (also name jQuery)
"div" - the name of an element using CSS selector

$("div") - represents every div on the page

addClass() - modifier method for the element

"special" - can be anything that executes as a result of the element being modified

Gracefully dies

$(".idontexist").addClass("special");

will not break the code.

The Ready Event

$(document).ready(function(){ 
    // Your jQuery code goes in here 
});

In order to traverse and manipulate the page we must wait until it's ready to be used.
jQuery has a ready event that fires the instant the DOM is ready to be worked with.
Stick all your jQuery code in a ready block, load it unobtrusively.
